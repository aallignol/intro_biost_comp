#+TITLE: Notes and ideas for the "Introduction to biostatistical computing (SS2015)"
#+OPTIONS: num:nil

In general try to bring a bit more structure in this

* Quick intro to R?

  - data types
  - get help (sos package, mailing list, stack overflow). Google in
    English
  - Install packages
  - debugging

* Reproducible research
  - keep a bit of the intro as motivation for reproducible research
  - Insist on good coding practice (comments, file and directory
    structure, write functions)
  - (If available) introduce git
  - Start right away
  - only do knitr
  - Would need some intro into markdown and latex  

* Data manipulation

  1. Reading/Writing data
  2. Factors and dates
  3. Strings
  4. Data aggregation/manipulation/reshaping/merging

* Graphics

  - A bit of theory
  - do a tiny bit of base graphics (for using plot methods mostly)
  - ggplot2

* Simulations

  - Try to do a bit more than last year.
  - By product: test code and debug
